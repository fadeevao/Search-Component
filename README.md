# Search-Component

This project is my internship project in July 2016.  
The main objective was to develop a user interface that will provide search capabilities in various file formats + under-the-hood query expansion. 

Overall, this is a GUI app built on top of Lucene's library. 
The app can be run both in GUI and command line mode.
